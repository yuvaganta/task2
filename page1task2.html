          Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow
          across borders. Where countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and
          eliminate road blocks. Where companies import goods and merchandise
          directly into a Free Trade Zone - and then ship products out duty
          free.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe and Asia to
          Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air and sea transportation
          links, plus rall and expressway. Operated by FTZ World Services, the
          47-acre Zone (#372) saves companies money and time.
